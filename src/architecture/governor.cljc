(ns architecture.governor
  "LandscapeGovernor — the independent safety/traceability layer for
  the ISCO-08 2162 independent landscape architect actor. Wired as its own
  `:govern` node in `architecture.actor`'s StateGraph, downstream of
  `:advise` — the Advisor has no notion of project provenance,
  environmental compliance or the landscape architect's professional/legal
  responsibility, so this MUST be a separate system able to reject a
  proposal (itonami actor pattern, per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section).

  `check` is a pure function of (request, context, proposal, store) ->
  verdict; it never mutates the store. The StateGraph's `:decide` node
  routes on the verdict:
    :hard? true                → :hold  (irreversible, no write)
    :escalate? true            → :request-approval (interrupt-before)
    otherwise                  → :commit

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. project provenance  — the request's project must be registered.
    2. no-actuation        — proposal :effect must be :propose.
    3. no-stamping/certification — any attempt to issue a stamped design
       or certify environmental compliance is a permanent block (that is the
       licensed landscape architect's exclusive professional responsibility).
  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off, per the
  README robotics-premise: stamped designs and environmental compliance
  certification always require human architect sign-off):
    4. :op :flag-environmental-compliance-issue (always escalates).
    5. design proposals affecting drainage/grading/environmental-sensitive systems.
    6. low confidence (< `confidence-floor`)."
